Once I reached the second half, however, I began to think that maybe the experiment was meant to test our ability to stay awake and concentrate on mundane tasks that don't require much mental work on our behalf.","I wasn't really paying attention to the number of points because it was up to chance. I noticed at the end of each part that I averaged a score of about +15,000 points each. I did wonder if I was going to be told how well I did compared to others but I was not sure. Even still, I felt satisfaction upon receiving high numbers, especially when my number was higher than the smaller version on the right.  ","During the beginning, I randomized my choices. Towards the middle, I began looking at the pattern of XX's, but noticed that that really didn't do anything, though the smaller version always seemed to go with the pattern of the XX's. By the end, I was just randomly choosing. If I was continuously getting high numbers with one side, I would continue choosing that side until I got a smaller number. To choose the initial side, however, I would weigh the numbers already presented and the likelihood that another high number would present itself. ","Because my strategy seemed to jump around quite a bit during the length of the experiment, I am not sure if it changed particularly between the short and long games, though it is possible. ",Absolutely. It was at about that time that I started to think if the device was not necessarily tracking my pupils and eye-movement so much as whether or not my eyes stayed open and how long it took  me to get sleepy or become less alert. ,"Distracted? Not as much after the inital 5 minute blank screen (which I assumed was also tracking my eye movement to monitor what we do during long periods of non-activity) in which I stared around my area noticing little things like the smudges on the screen and the lint flying around. It was difficult to stay on task, though I wasn't necessarily able to distract myself with my head being held still the way it was. Though honestly I am not sure how accurate my levels of distraction will be because I took medication for my ADHD.","I do not drink caffeine on a regular basis as I find it wears me out instead of hyping me up. If and when it DOES have an energizing effect, I feel that the crash afterwards is more counterproductive to my day/task.","Almost never on a console or computer. I play a few games on my phone, though I am not sure they constitute as games. I play Sudoku for many hours a day, Yahtzee for about an hour every day or so, and online poker for about an hour before bed every few days.",32.23379517,-110.9499969,-1
