I thought that it was low key trying to trick us by showing what other people chose but actually what they chose has nothing to do with your own odds so I picked the one that brought me the most points.,I think it was kinda easy becasue im pretty confident in my skills to make the right decsision so I just made it on what I thought would be the best.," id see like on one side 59 and 63 then on the right like 61 and 63 so I picked the 61 and 63 becasue if that is the bottom of the points then it only goes up and it is the middle then it can go up also, so Id pick that side and im pretty sure it usually worked out. I think lookink and trying to like guess the averages was the key and to not look at the other persons thing at all.","my strategy for both was the same, to try to get the most points by looking at the numbers already there and if one side had numbers that were higher and closer together then id pick that one.","No, I would have usually but im here for a reason so I wanted to not mess up the study for everyone that worked hard to make it.",not really ,no,"Yes, I like to play like sports games like madden and nba 2k16, I'll usually play them when im bored so sometimes if im not doing anything ill  play them for like the whole day, but if its like a normal school day and I have homework and classes I'll usually maybe just do it when im done with my work for an hour or till my friends want to hang out.",32.23379517,-110.9499969,-1
